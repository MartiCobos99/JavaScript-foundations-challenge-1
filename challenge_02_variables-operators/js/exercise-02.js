    2. On a separate line, assign the variable the String: "Moo!"
    3. Log out this variable to the terminal using console.log
    
    Repeat the above steps but try using a const variable. Comment this new part of code and explain what is happening.

//in variable of let type, no need to initialize it at definition time.
//on the contrary, the const type variable must be initialized at the time of definition because it does not allow having a death zone.
